# Post-Processing Subtitles
## Motivation
Torrented videos come in a wide variety of organisations.
Some come with subtitles at the same level as the main video file.
Others place subtitles in a sub directory.
However, Plex only recognises subtitle files placed in the same directory as the main video file.

For Plex to pick up subtitles in torrented videos, these subtitles must be reorganised into a canonical form that is understood by Plex.

## Nomenclature
Sidecar(adjective) subtitle: A subtitle that has been placed alongside a video file. Plex can index a video along with a sidecar subtitle

Sidecar(noun): Shortened form of sidecar subtitle

Sidecar(verb): The act of relocating a subtitle alongside a video file

Vobsub: DirectVobSub subtitle format. This subtitle format consists of an .idx and .sub file

## Scenario Summary
When reorganising subtitles, Plexpost looks at a couple of indicators. These indicators determine how the subtitles will be reorganised.

If a video already has a sidecar subtitle, no further action is taken.

Otherwise, Plexpost looks for a vobsub file recursively from the base directory. If a vobsub file is found, a copy of the idx+sub file is placed alongside the main video file.

Finally, if there are no vobsubs, the highest ranked sub will be sidecar-ed.

When new sidecar files are copied, the original will always be left intact. No subtitles files are deleted during torrent post processing.

| - | Y | Sidecar vobsub (2) | Do nothing (1) |

## Scenario 0
- No subtitles present

Do nothing

## Scenario 1
- Video has a sidecar subtitle
- Other subtitles may be present in sub directory

Do nothing

## Scenario 2
- Video has a vobsub subtitle in sub directory
- There are no sidecar subtitles
- There is one or more subtitles in sub directory

Sidecar vobsub files. Ignore other subtitles.

## Scenario 3
- One or more subtitles in sub directory
- No vobsub present
- No sidecar subtitles
